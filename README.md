# Summary

</div>

> Simple Rust asset loading derive macro for Enums, and a resource for learning
proc-macros!

Please feel free to offer any advice or create a pull request.

The original intent of this library was for compile time loading assets
into a binary. This will eventually allow for run-time loading as well,
but as for now that will be a future expansion.

## Example

```rust
use asset_derive::Asset;

#[derive(Asset)]
#[asset(basepath = "./icons/", ext = "svg")]
enum Icon {
    #[asset(ext = "png")]
    Select,
    Folder,
    #[asset(filename = "folder-dim")]
    FolderDim,
}
```

- [ ] Filename prefix
